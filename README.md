### Official and third-party libraries
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) The Progressive JavaScript Framework

- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) a modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance & extras.
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. It is isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase). On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.
- [Tiptap](dev) gives you full control about every single aspect of your text editor experience. Itâ€™s customizable, comes with a ton of extensions, is open source and has an extensive documentation. Join our welcoming community and start building cool things!
- [JS Cookie](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie) A simple, lightweight JavaScript API for handling browser cookies
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

### Style Guide
For consistency

- [Vue.js Strogly Recommended](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/#Priority-B-Strongly-Recommended) hese rules have been found to improve readability and/or developer experience in most projects. Your code will still run if you violate them, but violations should be rare and well-justified.
- [Editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs.
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code.
